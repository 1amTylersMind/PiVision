# PiVision
Experimenting with connecting a small camera to
a Raspberry Pi.

### *image_transfer.py* 
First method of transferring images, utilizing 
the wifi functionality of the Pi to upload the
images taken to github automatically.

### *Vision.py*
Trying out some crude ideas for basic computer
vision tasks like edge detection, and hopefully
more complicated tasks later on. 

### *cleanup_gpio.py* 
Just a trivial function to ensure that the LEDS
and GPIO setup is cleaned and killed in the event
of an image_transfer exiting with an error.
